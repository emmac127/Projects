# Projects
This is all the work I've done on my own to demonstrate my coding. Information on where the code is in the files will be in README text files.

GAME INSTRUCTIONS
In LinuritBuild, there is a demo of a game I implemented and designed assets for where the major gamep mechanic involes moving circles called "nodes" around by clicking and dragging. Each node can only destroy one other node connected to it, and it will be the one with the smallest distance away from it. The goal of each level is to set off a chain reaction of nodes being destroyed, so you have to click the play button the smallest possible number of times. The play button will destroy the currently selected node and set off a chain reaction of the closest connected node being destroyed until it there are no connected nodes remaining. Once finished, each level unlocks another level. In the future, I plan on implementing a themes page where you can unlock more colors and shapes of nodes and backgrounds.

WHERE TO FIND SCRIPTS
I created the game in Unity2D, but the scripts I made for the game are in the Projects/LocalLinurit/Assets/Scripts folder in C#

WHERE TO DOWNLOAD GAME
The mac os app itself is in the Projects folder and it's called LinuritBuild.app.
